# ML_code_practice
ML Practice is a hands-on learning space to build and improve machine learning skills through real-world datasets, model building, evaluation, and experimentation using Python and ML libraries.

# 📊 Machine Learning Basics – Real World Examples

This repository contains simple and beginner-friendly implementations of fundamental Machine Learning algorithms using small real-world datasets.

The goal of this project is to understand the core concepts of:

* ✅ Supervised Learning
* ✅ Unsupervised Learning
* ✅ Linear Regression (Single Variable)
* ✅ Multiple Linear Regression
* ✅ Classification (Logistic Regression)
* ✅ Clustering (K-Means)

All datasets used are small and manually created for learning purposes.


## 🚀 Algorithms Implemented

### 1️⃣ Supervised Learning – Classification

**Example:** Predict Pass/Fail based on study hours

* Algorithm Used: Logistic Regression
* Input: Study Hours
* Output: Pass (1) / Fail (0)


### 2️⃣ Linear Regression (Single Variable)

**Example:** Predict student marks based on study hours

* Algorithm Used: Linear Regression
* Input: Study Hours
* Output: Marks


### 3️⃣ Multiple Linear Regression

**Example:** Predict student marks based on:

* Study Hours
* Attendance Percentage


### 4️⃣ Unsupervised Learning – Clustering

**Example 1:** Group students based on marks in two subjects
**Example 2:** Customer Segmentation based on:

* Annual Income

* Spending Score

* Algorithm Used: K-Means Clustering


## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* Python
* NumPy
* Scikit-learn
* Matplotlib

```

2. Run any file:

```bash
python filename.py
```


## 🎯 Learning Outcomes

After completing this project, you will understand:

* Difference between supervised and unsupervised learning
* How regression works
* How classification works
* How clustering groups similar data
* How to train and test simple ML models


## 📌 Why Small Dataset?

This project is designed for:

* Beginners in Machine Learning
* College practical submissions
* Quick revision of ML fundamentals

Small datasets make it easier to understand model behavior clearly.


## 📖 Future Improvements

* Add model evaluation metrics (MAE, MSE, R², Accuracy)
* Add train-test split
* Add real dataset (CSV file)
* Deploy using Streamlit
